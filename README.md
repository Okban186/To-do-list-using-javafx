This is a basic To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. It includes a daily deadline update feature, though editing deadlines is not yet supported. 
Tasks are stored locally on the computer, and the app comes with a playful touch for cat lovers. :3
I have also built a standalone executable (ToDoList.exe) file for testing and easy use.
